* STMicroelectronics 10/100/1000 Ethernet driver (GMAC)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "snps,dwmac-<ip_version>" "snps,dwmac"
	For backwards compatibility: "st,spear600-gmac" is also supported.
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  that services interrupts for this device
- interrupts: Should contain the STMMAC interrupts
- interrupt-names: Should contain the interrupt names "macirq"
  "eth_wake_irq" if this interrupt is supported in the "interrupts"
  property
- phy-mode: String, operation mode of the PHY interface.
  Supported values are: "mii", "rmii", "gmii", "rgmii".
- snps,multicast-filter-bins:	Number of multicast filter hash bins
				supported by this device instance
- snps,perfect-filter-entries:	Number of perfect filter entries supported
				by this device instance

Optional properties:
- mac-address: 6 bytes, mac address
- resets: Should contain a phandle to the STMMAC reset signal, if any
- reset-names: Should contain the reset signal name "stmmaceth", if a
	reset phandle is given
- max-frame-size: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
- clocks: If present, the first clock should be the GMAC main clock,
  further clocks may be specified in derived bindings.
- clock-names: One name for each entry in the clocks property, the
  first one should be "stmmaceth".
- clk_ptp_ref: this is the PTP reference clock; in case of the PTP is
  available this clock is used for programming the Timestamp Addend Register.
  If not passed then the system clock will be used and this is fine on some
  platforms.
- snps,burst_len: The AXI burst lenth value of the AXI BUS MODE register.
- tx-fifo-depth: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
- rx-fifo-depth: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory

Examples:

	gmac0: ethernet@e0800000 {
		compatible = "st,spear600-gmac";
		reg = <0xe0800000 0x8000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&vic1>;
		interrupts = <24 23>;
		interrupt-names = "macirq", "eth_wake_irq";
		mac-address = [000000000000]; /* Filled in by U-Boot */
		phy-mode = "gmii";
		snps,max-mtu = <4062>;
		snps,multicast-filter-bins = <256>;
		snps,perfect-filter-entries = <128>;
		rx-fifo-depth = <16384>;
		tx-fifo-depth = <16384>;
		clocks = <&clock>;
		clock-names = "stmmaceth";
	};
